# Opynion

Some people feel that urge to air their opinions, sometimes wierd opinions. It could be any topic, and most times controversial topics, topics people are scared to talk about. This platform is user-centric and you are advised not to use your real name/details. Fanatics and Psychos still exists. This platform avails you the opportunity to say things the way you see them, just say what you need to say.

Let me summarize this with a quote from John Mayers's song, In the end its better to say too much than never to say what you need to say. ``John Mayer``
